## Screenshot/s
Not Yet.


## Setup
Download android studio, and API 32 version according to this project is initialized with this in gradle

You should open a firebase project and enable Authentication and realtime-database in order this project to work as you wish. I'll Explain what I can here.

1. Will add for you a json file to your project that manages the communication with firebase
2. Add some dependencies for the firebase system to work (Such as Authentication as we mentioned earlier)

Some Notes you should keep in mind:
1. The authentication works with Email&password (Firebase) after we are sending a payload of data to the database relating to the user.
2. You can change whatever you'll like in this project for your purposes.

In order to work with the Real-Time Database (Firebase),
We have to change some rules at https://console.firebase.google.com

Realtime Database/Rules: Change all values to true. If you're not going to change that so you will not be able to use this database. (From my research and experience (maybe there's a way))
